#+TITLE: journalist

(News)Feed generator. Journalist takes variety of sources (Atom/RSS feeds, my
saved bookmarks in org-roam, etc.), curates, transforms, and generates new feeds
in Atom format along with a dynamic OPML file. The aim is to pass this on to
something like FreshRSS so that I could get a less overwhelming, newspaper like,
information dump everyday.

* Usage
Since this is primarily a personal utility, the commands below might not make
sense to you for now. Anyway, here they are:

#+begin_src shell
  journalist generate pile-bookmarks (--notes-dir-path=<notes-dir-path>|--roam-db-path=<roam-db-path>) <output-file>
  journalist generate pile-bookmarks-projects (--notes-dir-path=<notes-dir-path>|--roam-db-path=<roam-db-path>) <output-file>
  journalist generate hf-papers <output-file>
  journalist generate recommended-links (--notes-dir-path=<notes-dir-path>|--roam-db-path=<roam-db-path>) <output-file>
  journalist merge --input=<input>... <output-file>
#+end_src
