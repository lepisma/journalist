#+TITLE: journalist

(News)Feed generator. Journalist takes variety of sources (Atom/RSS feeds, my
saved bookmarks in org-roam, etc.), curates, transforms, and generates new feeds
in Atom format along with a dynamic OPML file. The aim is to pass this on to
something like FreshRSS so that I could get a less overwhelming, newspaper like,
information dump everyday.
